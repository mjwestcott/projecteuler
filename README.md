# Project Euler solved in Python, Go, Clojure, and Ruby

## The project

This repository contains solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)
in Python, Go, Clojure, and Ruby. The aim is to complete problems 51-100.

I've tried to think about each problem from the perspective of each language
and solve them idiomatically. But given that some problems required hours of
research, you will find I often adopt the same strategy to solve them.

## Install

Use `docker-compose up` to run the solutions in all languages.

## History

I started working on these problems by
[forking](https://github.com/mjwestcott/pyeuler) the excellent
[pyeuler](https://github.com/tokland/pyeuler) repository, which solved problems
1-50 in a 'functional' style using Python.
